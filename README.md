# Sorry but I'm still busy focusing on my organometallic chemical research as a MS candidate in SIOC, CAS.
# I use GitHub as a platform for uploading programming exercises and personal work. 
# Although classical organic chemistry still has room for development, I hope to engage in cross research on machine learning and organic chemistry in the future.
