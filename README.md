Sorry but I'm still busy working on my organometallic chemical research as a MS candidate in SIOC, CAS. <br>
I use GitHub as a platform for uploading programming exercises and personal work. <br>
Although classical organic chemistry still has room for development, I hope to engage in cross research on machine learning and organic chemistry in the future.<br>
